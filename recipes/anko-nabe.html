    <p>What do you enjoy eating during the cold winter months? In Japan, the winter season means one thing: it’s time for hot pot. Families gather at one table to cook and eat together from a shared steamy pot. Surrounding the pot is smaller dishes of meat, seafood, and vegetables, all prepped and ready to be cooked in the broth and eaten in an intimate yet casual manner.
<br>
Depending on the regions, there are many different styles of hot pot dishes (Nabemono 鍋物) being enjoyed throughout Japan. What makes each hot pot different is what ingredients are used and how the soup broth is made. Today’s recipe Monkfish Hot Pot or Anko Nabe (あんこう鍋) is an iconic winter hot pot, especially popular in the eastern part of Japan</p>

    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>

    <h3>For Hot Pot</h3>
    <ul>1 lb monkfish (anko)</ul>
    <ul>¼ lb steamed monk fish liver (ankimo)</ul>
    <ul>3 shiitake mushrooms</ul>
    <ul>7 oz enoki mushrooms (1 package)</ul>
    <ul>1 inch carrot</ul>
    <ul>1 bunch shungiku (tong ho/garland chrysanthemum) (or any green leafy vegetable)</ul>
    <ul>1 Tokyo negi (naga negi; long green onion) (or several green onions)</ul>
    <ul>8 leaves napa cabbage</ul>
    <ul>14 oz medium-firm tofu (momen dofu) (1 block)</ul>
    <ul>1 package shirataki noodles (7 oz, 198 g)</ul>

    <h3>For Kombu Dashi (See Notes)</h3>
    <ul>4 cups water</ul>
    <ul>1 piece kombu (dried kelp) (3” x 4”, 7.5 cm x 10 cm)</ul>

    <h3>For Seasonings</h3>
    <ul>5 Tbsp miso (use red miso or awase miso)</ul>
    <ul>4 Tbsp soy sauce</ul>
    <ul>4 Tbsp mirin</ul>
    <ul>2 Tbsp sake (can substitute it with dry sherry or Chinese rice wine)</ul>

    <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
    <li>Gather all the ingredients first.</li>
    <li>Make kombu dashi by soaking the kombu into 4 cups water. I used Kombu Dashi this time but I have made this hot pot with Awase Dashi (Kombu + Katsuobushi (dried bonito flakes)) and they both taste wonderful.</li>
    <li>Cut the monkfish into larger bite-size pieces, about 1.5-2 inch pieces.</li>
    <li>Cut the steamed monkfish liver into ½ inch rounds. If you have raw liver, you will need to steam it for 10 to 20 minutes first.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Once boiling, add the monkfish to blanch for 15 seconds.</li>
    <li>Remove the fish from the pot and immediately transfer into a bowl of iced water. This will remove the fishy smell and help firm up the flesh of the fish. Once chilled, remove from the iced water and set aside.</li>
    <li>Cut the negi diagonally (If you use leek, rinse well to get rid of the dirt between them).</li>
    <li>Cut napa cabbage into bite-size pieces.</li>
    <li>Cut shungiku into 2-inch pieces and tofu into cubes.</li>
    <li>Discard the bottom part of enoki mushrooms and rinse quickly.</li>
    <li>Discard the stem of shiitake mushrooms and add the decorative cut if you like (See How to Make Decorative Shiitake). Cut out carrot flower (See How to Make Flower Carrot).</li>
    <li>Set a donabe (Japanese earthenware hot pot) over a portable stove at the table. You can also cook in a large pot on your stove top.</li>
    <li>Add the monkfish liver in the donabe and cook on low heat. As soon as the liver starts releasing oil, use a wooden spatula/ spoon to smash it into a paste or ground-meat-like texture. It may burn a little bit, but that’s okay as long as it’s very mildly charred. It adds more flavors.</li>
    <li>Once the liver gets pasty, add 5 Tbsp miso and combine well. Each miso brand/type has different saltiness and you just have to taste and decide if you need to add more (you will need at least 5 Tbsp).</li>
    <li>Gradually add kombu dashi while mixing the miso mixture.</li>
    <li>Add 4 Tbsp mirin, 2 Tbsp sake, and 4 Tbsp soy sauce, and mix well.</li>
    <li>Add negi (leek/green onion), the bottom tough parts of napa cabbage and shungiku, shirataki, enoki mushrooms, and monkfish.</li>
    <li>Let cook a little longer before you add in tofu and shiitake mushrooms.</li>
    <li>Once boiling, add leafy parts of napa cabbage and shungiku. Cover, and continue to cook for another 7-10 minutes. Skim fat and scum using a fine mesh sieve.</li>
    <li>Enjoy the hot pot and add more ingredients as you eat. When the broth is reduced, you may need to add more water (or dashi if you have extra).</li>
